    <ul>
        <li>What you were trying to do</li>

    <h3>I'm having trouble with push notifications</h3>

    <h3>Why do I need to allow photo library access?</h3>
    <p>The app needs access to your photos so you can attach images to your food posts. This helps other students see what food is available before they claim it. When you create a post, you can choose photos from your library or take new ones with the camera.</p>
